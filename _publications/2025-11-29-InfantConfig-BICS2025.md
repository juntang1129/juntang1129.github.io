## Abstract

Infants discover categories, detect novelty, and adapt to new contexts without supervision—a challenge for current machine learning.
We present a brain-inspired perspective on *configurations*[1,2], a finite-resolution clustering framework that uses a single resolution parameter and attraction–repulsion dynamics to yield hierarchical organization, novelty sensitivity, and flexible adaptation.
To evaluate these properties, we introduce `mheatmap`, which provides proportional heatmaps and reassignment algorithm to fairly assess multi-resolution and dynamic behavior.
Across datasets, configurations are competitive on standard clustering metrics, achieve 87\% AUC in novelty detection, and show 35\% better stability during dynamic category evolution.
These results position configurations as a principled computational model of early cognitive categorization and a step toward brain-inspired AI.
